[2025-03-18T04:48:43.162Z] apply an event handler instead of putting the events here

what if we do ask chatgpt to write a cool song and it whips smth as bad as thick of it
[2025-03-18T05:04:55.921Z] can we confirm that ksi DID ask chatgpt to write thick of it for him?
[2025-03-18T05:05:30.732Z] <@1068860427548770384> test take 3

[2025-03-18T05:06:09.930Z] just as bad
[2025-03-18T05:06:37.326Z] yeah
[2025-03-18T05:06:45.126Z] by using Thick of It as a baseplate
[2025-03-18T05:06:49.214Z] then it probably could
[2025-03-18T05:07:11.056Z] 
[2025-03-18T05:07:28.760Z] what if i just say "write me a cool song"
[2025-03-18T05:08:16.911Z] audio_store (for future voice features)
commands (for modularized commands)
encryptedfunc(idk, I just wanted to try obfuscation)
logs-storage (for checking which one of you cheeky fuckers are misusing the bot)
src (Stockfish Engine)
temp (for image analyzation)
