[2025-03-04T05:17:51.650Z] having an obfuscated function there sounds insane


```js
if(bannedPhraseWords.some(word => content.toLowerCase().includes(word))){
    await message.delete();
    message.channel.send(`${message.author}, your message contained prohibited words or phrases and was removed.`).then(msg =>{
      setTimeout(() => msg.delete(), 5000);
    });
    zrffntrUnaqyre(message);
    return;
  }
```
